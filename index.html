            Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
            Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”
            It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
            After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.

            

            As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities so that I can have fun with with a guessing game.

                Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.

            Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.

        
                The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.

            Display all the possible correct answers to the user.

                Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.
            
                As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.

            Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.
            

                In addition to the user stories stated above, continue to use console.logs throughout the code to track the questions that are being asked to the user, and add addtional CSS to style your HTML page.
            
                Stay within scope of what was taught so far in class. Do not write functions within your application. Use “helper” methods such as .includes() and .join(). Work with the instructional staff directly if you have questions about this requirement. -->

    <h1>My Bio</h1>
    <p>
        "Tommy Boy" grew up in central Florida to a lower middle class family with a typical Florida public
        education(yuck). School wasn't working out for him, so Tom dropped out when he was 16 and began working on his
        GED. Within a year, he had graduated and began working full time.
        <br>
        <br>

        By the time Tom had turned 19, he was living solo and working a very laborious job in metal fabrication and
        powdercoating for an up and coming aftermarket racing suspension company. Tom felt like he should be doing more,
        so he began looking at options for military service. Several months later, Tom was in basic training at Fort
        Sill, OK as an enlisted soldier in the Regular Army. He learned he was pretty good with a rifle and awful at
        pushups.
        <br>
        <br>

        Fast forward some years later and Tom is on his way home after being medically chaptered out of the Army. Things
        didn't go as planned. For a long while, Tom had a great deal of difficulty readjusting to living a normal,
        civilain life again. Various issues arose from injuries sustained during service arose over the years and it
        became more and more difficult to hold steady employment for any signifficant period of time.
        <br>
        <br>

        In 2023, Tom is a disabled veteran, attending Delta V so that he can learn how to build a website for his
        fiancé's stained glass business.
