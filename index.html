    <h1>My Bio</h1>
    <p>
        "Tommy Boy" grew up in central Florida to a lower middle class family with a typical Florida public
        education(yuck). School wasn't working out for him, so Tom dropped out when he was 16 and began working on his
        GED. Within a year, he had graduated and began working full time.
        <br>
        <br>

        By the time Tom had turned 19, he was living solo and working a very laborious job in metal fabrication and
        powdercoating for an up and coming aftermarket racing suspension company. Tom felt like he should be doing more,
        so he began looking at options for military service. Several months later, Tom was in basic training at Fort
        Sill, OK as an enlisted soldier in the Regular Army. He learned he was pretty good with a rifle and awful at
        pushups.
        <br>
        <br>

        Fast forward some years later and Tom is on his way home after being medically chaptered out of the Army. Things
        didn't go as planned. For a long while, Tom had a great deal of difficulty readjusting to living a normal,
        civilain life again. Various issues arose from injuries sustained during service arose over the years and it
        became more and more difficult to hold steady employment for any signifficant period of time.
        <br>
        <br>

        In 2023, Tom is a disabled veteran, attending Delta V so that he can learn how to build a website for his
        fiancÃ©'s stained glass business.
